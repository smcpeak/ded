To build it from the command line, run 'make'.

It will also build in Eclipse using the supplied project files.
There's nothing special in them though so you can disregard them
and use whatever IDE.

The only build dependency is the JDK.  It probably needs Java 1.5 or
later; I'm using 1.6 right now.

After building it, run the 'ded' script, which does:

  java -jar dist/ded.jar

Once it is running, Help|Help explains what to do.
