This text box contains JSON that configures the interaction with the
object graph.

Currently there is only one field, "showFields", which is an array of
objects that have a "key" and an optional "displayKey".  This determines
the sequence of attributes and pointers that are produced by the
"$(graphNodeShowFields)" variable.  When "displayKey" is present, that
is the key shown, even though the data is accessed using "key".  If the
array is empty, then all fields are shown.
