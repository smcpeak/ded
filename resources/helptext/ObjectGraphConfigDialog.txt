This text box contains JSON that configures the interaction with the
object graph.

Currently there is only one field, "showFields", which is an array of
field names.  This determines the sequence of attributes and pointers
that are produced by the "$(graphNodeShowFields)" variable.  If the
array is empty, then all fields are shown.
