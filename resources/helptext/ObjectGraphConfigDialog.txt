This text box contains JSON that configures the interaction with the
object graph.  (This crude interface is meant as a place-holder for a
proper GUI to be added later.)

newNodeName: If not null, the string to put into the Name field of an
Entity newly created to represent a graph node.  Otherwise, the default
value of "$(objectGraphID)" is used.

newNodeAttributes: If not null, the string to put into the Attributes
field of new Entity graph node.  Otherwise, the default value of
"$(graphNodeShowFieldsAttrs)\n\n$(graphNodeShowFieldsPtrs)\n" is used.

showFields: An array of field names.  This determines the sequence of
attributes and pointers that are produced by the
"$(graphNodeShowFields)" variable.  If the array is empty, then all
fields are shown.
