Usage: ded [options] [filename.ded]

Without options, starts the diagram editor, initially showing the
specified file if there is one, or an empty diagram otherwise.

Options:

  --help: Print this text and stop.

  --version: Print version and stop.

  --check-graph: Check the correspondence between the diagram and the
  object graph.

  --check-graph-source: Check the correspondence between the object
  graph stored in the diagram and the object graph stored in the file
  the diagram indicates is its graph source file.

Both --check-graph and --check-graph-source require that a file name be
passed, and cause the program to stop without opening the editor GUI.
They can be used simultaneously.
