This dialog shows all of the graph node attributes and pointers
associated with the graph node with the specified ID.  Pointers have a
"P" in the "P" ("Pointer?") column.

It can also be used to show and hide attributes and pointers that are
displayed in entities via the "$(graphNodeShowFields)" variable.  In the
first "Ord" column is either a blank space or a number.  Blank spaces
correspond to fields that are not shown, and numbered fields are shown,
in increasing order.  The numbers can be specified as decimal values to
insert fields between others, or very large or negative values to put
them at the ends.

To edit a cell, double-click it with the mouse, or use the cursor keys
to navigate, then start typing a number.

When the dialog is closed (with "Ok"), the global "show fields" sequence
will be updated according to the changes specified here.  Specifically,
elements that were not listed here are combined, using their original
sequential ordinal, with those that are listed here and have an ordinal.
That set of elements is then sorted by ordinal and becomes the new
sequence.  When the dialog is opened again, the ordinals will reflect
the elements' new positions in that sequence.
