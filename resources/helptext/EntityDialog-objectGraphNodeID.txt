This is the ID of the node in the object graph data source to display in
this entity box.  See the Help text of the "Diagram -> Edit object
graph..." dialog for more information on how to load a graph to begin
with.

To show object graph data within a node, use one of the following in its
Name and/or Attribute fields:

  $(graphNodeID): The node ID.

  $(graphNode.attributes): List of attributes, one per line.

  $(graphNode.followablePtrs): List of pointers for which there is not
  a corresponding edge yet, one per line.

  $(graphNode.attributesAndPtrs): The preceding two, concatenated.

  $(graphNode.<attr>): Any attribute of the node.

When a node is created by following a pointer (right click on an entity
that has pointers, then choose "Follow pointer"), it is initially
created with a Name and Attributes that uses the above variables.
