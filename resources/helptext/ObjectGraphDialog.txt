The text box contains JSON describing an object graph that can be shown
and explored using the diagram editor.

It must be a JSON object where each value is also an object, the latter
representing a node in a graph, with the key being its ID.  When an
entity's "Object graph node ID" is set to that value, the entity can be
visually populated with data from the node, and have the ability to add
edges corresponding to its pointers.

Within a node object, if a value is an object with a "ptr" attribute
with string value, and an optional "preview", that is treated as a
pointer to the node whose key is that value, and the preview will be
shown alongside the ID in $(graphNode.followablePtrs).  All other
attributes are treated as scalar fields of the node.

Example:
```
  {
    "n1": {
      "title": "one",
      "succ": { "ptr": "n2", "preview": "en two" },
    },
    "n2": {
      "color": "green",
      "pred": { "ptr": "n1" },
    },
  }
```
Within the diagram editor, when an entity is associated with a node that
has pointers, you can right-click on the entity and choose to "Follow
pointer", thereby creating the corresponding destination entity and an
edge to it.

See the Help text for the "Object graph node ID" field in the Edit
Entity dialog for details on how to show object graph data within a
node.

The intended usage model of this dialog is to create the JSON using some
external program, then copy+paste it into this box for exploration.
