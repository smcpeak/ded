The "Source file" is an optional file name, interpreted as relative to
the directory containing the DED file, containing JSON data with which
to populate the text box in this dialog.

Pressing the "Load" button reads that file, parses it as JSON, then
compares to the JSON already in the box.  If it is different, the loaded
data will replace what is in the box and a message box will say that new
data was loaded.  Otherwise, the text will remain unchanged, and a
message box will say so.  If the text in the box cannot be parsed as
JSON, the "new data" message will also be printed.  (The idea is to make
it easy to check if the data is different from what the box already
contains.)

Even after loading new graph data, if you press Cancel, the graph data
from before opening the dialog will be retained.  (And even if you press
OK, you can then still use Undo to recover the original graph.)

The source file name entered here is saved as part of the diagram (when
you press OK), regardless of whether it is used to load anything.

The source file name is not used in any other way than described above,
so it is fine if it sometimes does not exist or is different from the
loaded graph data.  The diagram always maintains its own copy of the
graph, which is written to the DED file (and the PNG) when the diagram
is saved.
