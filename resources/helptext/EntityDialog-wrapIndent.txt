When the "Wrap text" dropdown is set to "Never", the text is not
wrapped, and will simply flow off the right edge of the entity box and
be clipped when the entity is drawn.

When it is "At whitespace", lines can be broken at the transition from
non-whitespace to whitespace characters (replacing the contiguous
whitespace at that point with a line break) to make them fit into the
entity box.  If there are not enough break candidates, the unbreakable
text will again run off the right edge and be clipped.

When it is "After sentences", lines can be broken whenever one of the
characters in {'.', '?', '!', ':', ';'} is followed by whitespace,
again replacing the contiguous whitespace with a line break.

When a line is broken, the number of spaces specified by "Indent" are
inserted at the start of the new line.
