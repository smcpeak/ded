Pre-release test plan
---------------------

This is a work-in-progress test plan.  I intend to expand it as I add
new features I can't easily test automatically.



---------------------
Test: make_check

* Run "make check".

  Check that it succeeds.


---------------------
Test: objgraph

* Run "./ded tests/objgraph.ded".

  Check that attribute "succ: -> n2" appears in the "n1" box.

  Check that "anotherAttrib: 123" is in "n1".

  Check that "bad_id" has in its attributes area:
  <no node with ID: "bad_id">

  Check that below that is a node whose title area says:
  <No such attr key: "badAttr">

* Right-click on "n1", "Follow pointer", "succ".

  Check that "n2" is created with a "succ" edge to it.

  Check that "succ" is no longer displayed in "n1".

* Resize "n2" so all of its text can be seen.

  Check that "pred" is in "n2".

* Right-click on "n2", "Follow pointer", "pred".

  Check that a "pred" edge going back to "n1" has been created.

  Check that "pred" no longer is in "n2".

* Right-click on "n1", "Follow pointer", "notHere".

  Check that an error appears about no "null" node found.

* Dismiss the error.

* Choose menu "Diagram" -> "Edit object graph..."

  Check that the JSON is displayed in the dialog.

* Insert "x" at the start of the JSON, then press Ok.

  Check that a parse error dialog is shown.

* Dismiss the error.

  Check that we are back at the JSON dialog.

* Remove the stray "x".

* Delete the "anotherAttrib" line, then press Ok.

  Check that the dialog closes successfully.

  Check that "anotherAttrib" is gone from "n1".

* Quit without saving.
