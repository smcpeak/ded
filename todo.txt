TODOs for Diagram Editor
------------------------

Small:
- help window not modal
- toolbar: create elements, other keyboard shortcuts
- labels that (optionally) work more like Powerpoint
  - word wrap
  - edit in place
- adjust relation creation to be more intuitive
  - esp. compared to entity creation
- do not pop up box for "cannot edit"?
- undo history: click to "go there"
- option to route edges from the center of the edge of the bounding
  box rather than from the center of the entity
- fix relation creation to not have the offset problem
- allow creating relations that are not bound to an entity but
  whose edge overlaps an entity
- rendering for relations with entities pointing to overlapping,
  perhaps container or containee, entities
- bidirectional relations with separate labels for each direction
- allow label on inheritance edge
- arrow keys to move; ctrl-arrow to resize; shift to not snap
- entity grouping
- better self-loop rendering
- specify initial size (etc.?) for new relations
- option to automatically expand entities to contain their title and attributes
- flag to turn off auto move/resize of window contents

Medium:
- zooming, panning
- allow editing multiple elements at the same time
- smarter relation routing
- help bubbles
- file versioning that allows independent extensions

Big:
- add automated testing for the UI

Measuring effect of various "triple buffering" image types

Using test.ded, on 20th sample:
  normal: 810 FPS (no "triple" buffering)
  ARGB: 345 FPS
  RGB: 602 FPS
  compatible: 547 FPS (but was about to hit 600; think is same as RGB)
  USHORT_555_RGB: 142 FPS
